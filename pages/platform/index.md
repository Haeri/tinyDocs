# Platform

The DataSpace is a self-contained platform and can be either deployed on-prem or in a cloud infrastructure. This is made possible by dockerizing all of its modules which makes the entire system more resilient and horizontally scalable. For more details about the infrastructure see [Infrastructure](/infrastructure)

## Key Features

Following are some key features

### Hosted Platform

A major advantage of a hosted platform to a regular local development setup is the zero overhead of onboarding and environment setup. As soon as a new developer gets access to the platform, they can start working on the code right away without having to install any dependencies. Furthermore, the data never leaves the platform which increases security and enables data governance.


### Real-Time Lineage

The platform reacts to changes to the lineage in real time. Even when multiple developers are working on the pipeline at the same time, the changes to the build status and dependency graph are streamed in and
